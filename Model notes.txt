Trial 13 multiple non overlapping cards with glare:
Accuracy on tests: Correct: 31 Almost: 5 Incorrect: 11 Incorrect due to slight mask error: 6.5
Improvement suggestions: Figure out if the synthetic glare is helping. (If it is try adding shadows), Look for biggest mask.
Percentage = 33.5/47 = 71.3%

Trial 14 (Same as 13 but without glare):
Correct: 35 Almost: 2 Incorrect: 10 Incorrect due to slight mask error: 4
Percentage = 36/47 = 76.6%
Improvement Suggestions: If prediction is far off take bounding box instead without perspective transforming. (Fixes slight segmentation mask errors)

Trial 15 (no glare Larger dataset with more sets allow slight card overlap 2 to 5 cards per):
Correct: 36 Almost: 4 Incorrect: 7 Fixable by using box: 4
Percentage: 38/47 = 80.9%
Improvement Suggestions: Check box and mask, develop model or some other method to find correct orientation, use more backgrounds with grainy textures

Trial 16 (Much larger data set 50k):
Correct: 78 Almost: 4 Incorrect: 9 Fixable by looking at box: 4
Percentage: 80/91 = 88% If look at box as well: 84/91 = 92.3%
Still struggles with heavy angled pictures and borderless cards

Trial 17 (Adding random noise and reduced quality):
Correct: 90 Almost: 3 Incorrect: 13 Fixable by looking at box: 6 (Maybe find largest contour)
Percentage = 85%
Trying largest contour/box: 92%
Looking at largest contour:
Correct: 107 Almost: 3 Incorrect: 9
Percentage: 91%
Need to figure out borderless
