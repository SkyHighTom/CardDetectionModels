Implemented altered steps from https://github.com/jslok/card-scanner to better fit my use case. Further extended to use for Yu-Gi-Oh and MTG.

Used YOLO-segv8 to train 3 different models on Yugioh, Pokemon, and Magic: The Gathering cards. The weights for the Pokemon model can be found in the latest run of SegmentationTraining. The weights for the Yugioh and MTG models can be found in the latest run of YugiohModel and MTGModel, respectively. The Pokemon model was trained using 50000 images containing cards pasted onto random backgrounds (40k for training and 10k for validation). The MTG model was trained using 75000 images (60k training, 15k validation). The Yugioh model was trained using 40k images (32k training, 8k validation). Each model achieved over 90% accuracy on its respective test folder. Example images used to train models can be found in ExampleImages.
